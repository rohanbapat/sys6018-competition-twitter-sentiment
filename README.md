Reflection
 Who might care about this problem and why?
Let’s consider two aspects of ‘this problem’. In the broad sense, the problem under consideration is determining the sentiment of given text. Clearly, a multitude of industries, corporations, policy makers, multimedia content producers, public relations firms  etc. could find an application for sentiment analysis in their day to day lives. A few examples of how sentiment analysis can be employed in different occupations are:
1.	Gauging the reaction of citizens to a particular policy, politician, bill under consideration etc.
2.	Movie production houses can analyze the general viewer sentiment using social media posts.
3.	A PR firm can use sentiment analysis on social media  to determine how the public feels the client they are representing.
One interesting example is how an advertising company in Texas, built an algorithm to analyze the president’s tweets and trade in the stock market if the president commented negatively about a company. 
More specifically, companies researching and testing autonomous vehicles would be particularly interested in the inference of this analysis. These include Google, Uber, Tesla etc. Policy makers would also be interested, as adoption of autonomous vehicles could lead to policy changes in current automobile rules and regulations.
Why might this problem be challenging?
The ‘Sentiment Analysis’ problem is particularly challenging as:
1.	Text Analysis is involved. Language is continuously evolving, and social media text does not strictly adhere to the grammatical constructs of the English language. 
2.	Human emotion like sarcasm, and exclamation is difficult to decipher using traditional text mining techniques. Many phrases and words can be used in multiple contexts.
3.	Deciphering meaning in context would require huge amounts of computing power. Till date, researchers have restricted themselves to bigram and tri-gram models.
4.	Training data has to be hand annotated. This is hugely dependent on human resources, requiring huge amounts of manual effort. Additionally, it is a highly subjective process and hence has to be carried out by multiple people to be viable. This is extremely expensive.
Why other problems resemble this problem?
Other problems like determining audience sentiment towards autonomous vehicles includes:
1.	Based on previous movie reviews and respective rating, determine the rating of a movie.
2.	Based on cosmetic product reviews, determine overall sentiment of the product and authenticity of the reviews.
